This folder contains all scripts that are relevant to Raspberry Pi4 (topping Pi).
The function of RPi4 is to receive a message from RPi2 and dispense toppings accordingly.
RPi4 also communicates with the Firebase db to keep track of toppings amount and retrieve orders.
To run RPi4 in terminal, first start the pigpio daemon thread and then run the main_rpi4.py script.
