___
1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
  - 6 hours
2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)
   1. Top item: design, 3 hours
   2. 2nd item: brainstorming, 2 hours
   3. 3rd item: meetings, 1 hour

3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - Met with team members during the lab3 time in order to decide on and finalize our project idea, which has been collectively choosen to be a robotic sandwich maker
  - Discussed, collectively, the chosen project idea with our TA during the lab3 time in order to explore the project requirements and set out exactly how the robotic sandwich maker will satisfy the requirements. Moreover, it was evident that we need to satisfy the following at the absolute minimum: 
    * The use of 4 Raspberry Pis or other computers
    * The use of 4 sensors or actuators, with a condition of including at least one of each type
    * The implementation of 1 feedback loop affecting behaviour of a second Raspberry Pi or computer
    * Having 1 local Data Base with a minimum of 2 tables
    * Implementing a notification trigger such as an SMS, Email, or a Push notification
    * Having 1 bidirectional GUI affecting the operation of another Raspberry Pi
  - Therefore, it was concluded the use of the following components will be needed: 
    * 4 Raspberry Pis
    * 1 motor
    * 3 infrared trip wire sensors
    * 3 actuators or servos that release a hopper door
    * 1 ultrasonic liquid level sensor
    * 1 liquid pump
    * 1 conveyor belt 
    * 1 local SQL database
    * 1 online ordering GUI for a customer
    * 1 employee GUI for checking sauce level 
  - Researched and learned about UML Deployment Diagrams in order to complete the Deployment Digram needed as part of the 1 page pre-proposal
  - Joined the group project GitHub repository and created the subfolder for Weekly Update Reports
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - I think the progress I made this week is excellent considering all the deadlines have been met, the project idea was finalized, and all the specific components of the project have been decided on. 
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - I am planning to start working on the proposal draft document given it is due next week
  - I am also looking to work on the feedback reflection that is due next week
  - I would like to meet with the team some time in order to discuss further steps in the project
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - None so far
